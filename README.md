# Space_Missions_PowerBi_Project
Overview:

A dynamic, interactive data visualization tool built to explore Power BI report analyzing all space missions from 1957 to 2022 — uncovering trends in rocket launches, mission outcomes, top-performing countries, and cost insights using real-world launch data.

Purpose:

The Space Missions Dashboard is a visually engaging and analytical Power BI report designed to explore global rocket launches and mission outcomes over the past six decades. It highlights mission success trends, rocket performance and country-wise contributions to space exploration. This project is intended for space industry analysts, data-driven strategists, and enthusiasts seeking to understand how mission outcomes and investments have evolved across time, rockets, and geographies.

Tech Stack:

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation

• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.

• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.

• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

Data Source: [Space Missions Dataset – Maven Analytics]
